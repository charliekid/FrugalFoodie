# Frugal Foodie Application


## Project Description

Frugal Foodie is an application that generates recipes based on ingredients or weekly sale ads. 
When using the weekly sale ad feature, the application will produce the least expensive recipe for the user. 

This application addresses a few different issues. First is the issue of the amount of time people 
spend planning for their weekly meals. For those on budget, buying items on sale can save their 
household a lot of money. One could spend hours looking through ads and coordinating it with their 
cookbook. This application will also save the user time on deciding on which recipe to make. 
Eliminating indecisiveness.  

## Project Requirements

- [ ] Must use Git
- [ ] Must use Git project boards
- [ ] Must have persistent data

- [ ] Multiple access level (e.g. a normal user and an admin user)
- [ ] Must have a central location to allow users to share information. e.g. if userA logs in and posts a picture, userB should be able to login and view that picture. This can be accomplished by using creating a web API or by using a service like Firebase
